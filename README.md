Kantai Collection Vita Translation Kai
======================================

This is a work in progress project to produce a Kantai Collection Vita
multilingual translation.

Participants of this project are required to abide by the
[CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Installing The Translation
--------------------------

### Prerequisites
This assumes you have:
* a PS Vita
* VitaShell installed
* rePatch installed
* KanColle Kai v1.00 with patch v1.02 installed
* about 3gb free on the Vita
* a downloaded patcher executable from our [releases section](https://github.com/wchristian/kc-vita-translation/releases)

### Preparation
If you have the prerequisites, follow these steps to prepare:
* on your PC, create a path somewhere like this: `d:\kancolle_kai_original\repatch\PCSG00684\`
* in Vitashell, navigate to `ux0:data/`, triangle > new > new folder, name it kcv
* in Vitashell, navigate to `ux0:app/`, put the selector on `PCSG00684`, triangle > open decrypted
* move down the list, mark each entry with square, then triangle > copy
* navigate to `ux0:data/kcv/`, triangle > paste, that'll take a while
* in Vitashell, navigate to `ux0:patch/`, put the selector on `PCSG00684`, triangle > open decrypted
* move down the list, mark each entry with square, then triangle > copy
* navigate to `ux0:data/kcv/`, triangle > paste, that'll take a while
* hit select to connect the vita to your pc and copy the content of `ux0:data/kcv/` into `d:\kancolle_kai_original\repatch\PCSG00684\`
* this folder will act as a backup in the future, keep it as is. maybe zip if it you're tight on space
* delete `ux0:data/kcv/`

### Installation
With preparations done, time to create the actual translation patch
* create a copy of the folder `d:\kancolle_kai_original\` as `d:\kancolle_kai_translation\`
* run the patcher executable, and select `d:\kancolle_kai_translation\` as the folder for it to work in and click start
* once done, copy the repatch folder inside `d:\kancolle_kai_translation\` to `ux0:` on your vita, repatch must be in the root of the ux0: drive

Now you can run the game with the translation patch.
